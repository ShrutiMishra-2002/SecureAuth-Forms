      1- Verify if all input fields meet the requirements (first name - last name - email - phone - password)
      2- Verify whether the verification email was sent or not.
    - Out of scope: all non-functional tests, such as load and performance tests and UI tests.


# How to run this project:
1- Install java and eclipse IDE.
2- Install TestNG extension to eclipse (from eclipse marketplace). 
3- Add selenium JARs as external JARs to the project (JARs exist in the folder "selenium").
4- The class newtest: it contains all methods used to perform test cases.
